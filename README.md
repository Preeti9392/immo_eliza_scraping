# Immoweb Real Estate Scraper

This project provides a **web scraper for Belgian real estate listings** from [Immoweb](https://www.immoweb.be/). The scraper collects **property URLs** and extracts **detailed attributes** such as bedrooms, bathrooms, surface area, and building conditions. It leverages **multi-threading** for faster scraping and saves results into CSV files for further analysis or machine learning projects.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The scraper performs two main tasks:

1. **URL Collection**  
   - Generates base URLs for **houses and apartments** for a specified number of pages.  
   - Scrapes individual property URLs from search pages while ignoring new real estate projects.  
   - Saves the list of URLs to `immoweb_url_file.csv`.

2. **Property Attribute Extraction**  
   - Extracts property details (key-value pairs) from individual property pages.  
   - Scrapes information such as `bedroomCount`, `toilet_and_bath`, `habitableSurface`, `facedeCount`, `hasTerrace`, `totalParkingCount`, `type`, `subtype`, `province`, `locality`, `postCode`, `buildingCondition`, `epcScore`.  
   - Saves the extracted dataset to `dataset_file.csv`.
